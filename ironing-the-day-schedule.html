				<p style="color: gray"><i>This one is a small one. I am losing the grip to write these. Need to make accomodations on my calendar to write these early in the morning. Tired of writing these in night. Like this article.</i></p>

				<p>Last month I experimented and wrote about having an anchor event in the morning. As a result, my days were more productive!</p>

				<p>I try to learn something new every day. A few days after writing that article, my days slowly changed. Something was different. </p>

				<p>On the bright side, I was self-aware and had more free time for buying groceries! Life was great.</p>

				<p>But on the darker side, my mornings were starting to cramp up. I'd find myself confused and distracted by work. It didn't make any sense.</p>

				<p>"Too many tasks in the morning" was a new issue that I had to solve. Some days it was barely an inconvenience when I could power through everything. But most of the days, I couldn't power through.</p>

				<p>Just an FYI, "Powering through" shouldn't be a regular option. It's more of a once in a while kinda thing. Every day should be calm and peaceful. That's the reason I started using calendars, added anchor events.</p>

				<p><i>How am I going to overcome this?</i></p>

				<br>
				<h3>My Solution</h3>
				<p>I am going to continue with having Anchor Events. But will be planning non-sequential anchor event's throughout the week's plan. It means a few things.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I'll be planning the entire week on Mondays.</li>
					<li>I am going to set a few goals for the week.</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<h4>Changes to schedule</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Morning Hours Uptill 9 AM there can only be one block per hour.</li>
					<li>Post 9 AM, the workday starts.</li>
					<li>Give plenty of time for each event. </li>
					<li>Some calls require a follow-up by sending a document or file. That's why schedule phone calls an hour before lunch.</li>
				</ol>


				<br>
				<h3>Side note</h3>
				<p>Since I am writing daily here, I should maybe restart writing on Quora.</p>

				<p><b>Topics:</b> Learning to Code, TV Shows, Writing daily.</p>
