			<h1 class="cover-heading">My Plan To Find 5 Investable Companies</h1>
			
			<div>
				<p>There are about 7,000 companies listed in India. I aim to invest (monthly) in at least 5 of them. The task on hand is to find the top 5 companies which would give me return in 15-20 years.</p>

				<p>I'm 27 right now. 47 seems to be a decent age to be worth a few crores. I have had a lot of goals in the past. I have given up on a landslide majority of them. I hope I don't give-up this goal.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>How do I Plan To Do This?</h2>
				<p>Buy a good Screener, go through all 7,000 listings. Easy. A little time consuming, but I suppose it's worth it.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Calculating... </h2>
				<p>How long it'll take to find 5 assets from 7,000 companies? (I should use better words to describe. Saying company sounds like I know nothing, which is true)</p>

				<p>If I spend a day at 1 company, it'll take me 19 years to go through all the listings. I don't think I have that much time. Need a faster method.</p>

				<p>Let's start by eliminating the obvious</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Nothing from Nifty 50, and Next 50. They are too obvious.</li>
					<li>No Banks. I don't understand them.</li>
					<li>No Health Care. No idea how they operate.</li>
					<li>No Sin Stocks. (Tobacco, Alcohol, etc) I know this is a high yield. But meh. Wanna keep my money halal.</li>
					<li>No Airlines. God knows when they'll be profitable.</li>
					<li>No Oil and gas. I mean, does it still have a future? I have no knowledge of it. #GoTesla</li>
					<li>Materials. I have no idea what this is. Why are people betting on Copper and Lead? IDK.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>After all these, I may have eliminated a good chunk of assets.
				This should give me a shorter list of companies to study.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>What I Look In A Business</h2>
				<p>A founder or management who loves what they do. See, I am not interested in investing companies like Asian paints or Titan <sup>*</sup>. I am more interested in investing companies like See's Candies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See%27s_Candies">Wikipedia</a>. <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2007ltr.pdf">Berkshire Hathaway letter's to shareholders</a>: Read page 6-7.</p> 

				<p>Ever since I read those two pages, I have had a special interest <sup>**</sup> in finding undervalued companies. Something so boring and unexciting, fewer people would think of buying shares from.</p>

				<p>In the words of Charlie Munger, I am looking for undervalued assets that could be bought cheaply.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>What I Should be Looking</h2>
				<p>Here are a few things I'd be more inclined to</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Based In India. Preferably Hyderabad. But only because I'd want to go visit them.</li>
					<li>Tech-based startup. Although I am also ok with others. It has to be interesting in a competitive market.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Simple things I'd look at:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>EBITDA,</li>
					<li>Cash flow,</li>
					<li>Total Revenue,</li>					
					<li>Do I know the product?,</li>
					<li>How much is the profit per unit?,</li>
					<li>What is their distribution strategy?,</li>
					<li>Is the product/service a need or a want?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Asking these questions, will either spark an interest or put water over it. I need to ask these questions fast and move on.</p>

				<p>If I am investing in a company, I should know everything there is to know about them. Including their:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>history,</li>
					<li>future plans,</li>
					<li>CEO's psychology,</li>
					<li>customer base, and</li>
					<li>verticals.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I can't think of anything more. But I have a feeling I should be knowing more about the company.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Ending This</h2>
				<p>This was just a brain dump of my investing plan. Will get better as I move along.</p>

				<p><sup>*</sup> When I say that I don't mean I actively would go after looking for such companies. If I get hold of such business, I won't miss the chance.</p>

				<p><sup>**</sup> special interest. Like everything else in life, I read about a few companies and gave up after a few weeks. Wish I could start reading about at least 2 companies every week.</p>
