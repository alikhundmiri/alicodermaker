This goes back to childhood. When my parents slept, I felt like I had the most freedom. It's not true. I was always free as a kid to choose what I wanted to. 
Every kid is creative. In their own unique way.  The amount of of freedom a kid has, or they think they had, determines how early they sleep in the night.
