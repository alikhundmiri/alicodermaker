					<p><strong>A Note</strong> This is like an open letter to my friend. Feel free to read and implement it for your own business</p>
				</div>

				<p>Hey Tabu!</p>

				<p>I saw that you have started a social media account for your Jewellery shop. I thought of messaging you offering my help. But I know you won't reply as early as I want you to.</p>

				<p>Business who thrive on offline sales thinks it won't get an as big result as other forms of marketing. But trust me it'll work out. <i>But</i>. There's a <i>but</i> here. It'll take time. Keep a year in mind. I know how businesses react to social media. But you need to invest more time than money into this to get results</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Let Me Brag My Knowledge About Your Business</h2>
				<p>Here's the thing about gold. Indians are obsessed with it. I can even go ahead and say this is an unhealthy obsession. Women want gold. Women get gold. </p>

				<p>For a brand like yours, the first step is to establish a niche. By that mean, select a group of people, and focus on selling and marketing to them!</p>

				<p>At this point most businesses say "this feels counter-intuitive". Yes, you are eliminating a huge chunk of potential buyers. But when it comes to setting a brand, the niche is important.</p>

				<p>Please go ahead and pick a niche you are suitable with. For the simplicity of explanation, I'll pick "Independent Women of 2021" as my niche. Feel free to change it for your purposes.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>About This Niche</h2>
				<p>The people falling under your niche is a woman who:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>is in her late 20s to 30s,</li>
					<li>may or may not be married,</li>
					<li>has a job,</li>
					<li>lives in your city.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Ideally, I should add a few more points to this list. But I think I have narrowed it down plenty much. Now I am going to humanise her, and call her Nari from here on out. </p>

				<br>
				<h4>Data from Facebook</h4>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Classification</th>
						<th>Number of people</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total people in your city</td>
						<td>490,000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total people in your city in 20s to 30s</td>
						<td>380,000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total Women in your city in 20s to 30s</td>
						<td>64,000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total Women in your city in 20s to 30s who prefer mid and high-value goods</td>
						<td>12,000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total Women in your city in 20s to 30s who prefer high-value goods</td>
						<td>7,200</td>
					</tr>
					
				</table>

				<br>
				<h3>What Does Nari Want</h3>
				<p>Now you know who Nari is, you can ask the next question. How can we get Nari into your store, and serve her the best Jewellery she has ever seen.</p>

				<p>We have to invest time to know Nari better. Talk to her. We need the following questions answered:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>what are her struggles?</li>
					<li>how does she want to be perceived?</li>
					<li>is she wealth driven or status-driven?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Again, I should add a few more questions to this list. The goal here is to get to know her better.</p>
				<p>The next step is to care about here. </p>

				<br>
				<h3>Care about Nari</h3>
				<p>On Youtube, you'll find 100s of apology videos from people who didn't care about their audience. </p>
				<p>Don't pick a niche, if you don't care about them. Stand behind them when things are though for them. Social media is less* about sales and more about caring.</p>

				<p>This should reflect in your content. </p>

				<p>If you care about them, they will care enough to buy from you. </p>

				<p><i>* I said less. In the end, you are running a business. Business needs profits. But that doesn't we cross a line.</i></p>

				<br>
				<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
				<p>Let's talk about social media. [finally]</p>
				<p>Currently, your feed is full of product photos and a few models. That's ok. It can be better.</p>

				<p>For your niche audience, jewellery is not an impulse buy. They plan and wait for an opportunity to buy jewellery.</p>

				<p>Some occasions include</p>
				<ul>
					<li>festivals,</li>
					<li>birthday,</li>
					<li>promotions,</li>
					<li>bonus check,</li>
					<li>inheriting old jewellery,</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You will find more than these. You are in business.</p>

				<p>People don't decide to buy jewellery by looking at jewellery. They wait for occasions to buy jewellery.</p>

				<p>This might sound silly, but you get more reach when you post less about your jewellery. Focus more on the importance of these events and occasions for Nari.</p>

				<p>Because Nari has friends and she shares content which felt relatable to them.</p>

				<p>There's more that needs to be discussed here. Will write more tomorrow!</p>
