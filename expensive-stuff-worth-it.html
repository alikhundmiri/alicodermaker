				<p>Growing up we lived next to a sandwich shop. It was one block away, a 5-minute walk.</p>

				<p>I'd go with my father and watch him order. He's always ordered the same thing. Five of 2 riyals Tamiya. It's like Shawarma but instead of meat, it's filled with deep-fried Falafel. In it, they'd add french fries, and chopped lettuce, 3-4 types of sauces. It was my absolute favourite. If you still can't picture it, think Subway, but local! <chef kiss>.</p>

				<p>As I grow up, I'd visit the shop without my father, and order the same item. One day when I was 13 or so, I noticed the menu board. They had ten items, price going up from left to right. Our usual order was third from left.</p>

				<p>I asked the shopkeeper "what's that fifth item on your menu?"</p>
				<p>The shopkeeper replied, "It's the same as your always order. It costs 2 riyals more and you get more french fries and Falafel stuffings". After making sure I had enough money, I got the bigger sandwich.</p>

				<p>The bigger size of the food I like to eat? Yes, please.</p>

				<p>The next time I visited, I asked him "what's that item on the rightmost?" to which he replied, "It's the same as your usual order, but instead of Falafel, this one has chicken nuggets".</p>

				<p>Before this, I've never had a chicken nuggets sandwich. But in my mind I know this was going to be the tastiest thing in this shop. Ordering something this expensive was out of the question. But I wanted it.</p>

				<p>I settled for the usual order. It had the same ingredients and condiments. But this time it wasn't as tasty as it used to be. Something was different.</p>

				<p>What changed was my mindset. Earlier I enjoyed my usual order. But now that I've seen there's something better out there, my perspective changed. The crazy part is. I didn't even have the chicken nugget sandwich. All I know is there exists an expensive item at the place I enjoy eating sandwiches.</p>

				<p>The crazier part is when I finally had the money to buy the chicken nuggets sandwich, it wasn't as good. I ruined the taste of something I was fond of. Only because I thought "higher the cost better the taste".</p>
