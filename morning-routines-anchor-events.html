					I don't know much about having productive days. Throughout my life, I have had a collection of unproductive days. For some reason, I'd have one random day when I am active, productive and happy about it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since I started writing these daily blogs, I have a productivity streak. I believe it is because of an anchor event in the daily calendar.
				</p>

				<p>
					Lets me explain it all...
				</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Anchor Events</h2>
				<p>
					An anchor event is something you do daily almost every day of the week, including weekends. I call it an "anchor" event because it stops your regular workflow and makes space for itself.
				</p>

				<p>
					Examples of Anchor event could be:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Writing a Journal or a daily blog (like this one),</li>
					<li>Exercising (weights, body or cardio),</li>
					<li>Cleaning the room, or</li>
					<li>Doing dishes.</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<h2>Using Calender</h2>
				<p>
					I have always fancied using calenders. Makes you look professional. But in practice, I find calenders very difficult to use. I also find it hard to force myself to do the actual task in the calendar.
				</p>

				<p>
					<i>With that said,</i> I started having two anchor points in my day. One in the calendar and one in my mind. Every day I'd close my laptop at 7:30 pm and start working on dinner.
				</p>

				<p>
					And the other anchor point in my mind: write this blog. I'd usually write these blogs in the night, before sleeping. around midnight or 1 am. But sometimes I write it in the morning before starting my work, like this post today. I prefer to write these articles in the morning.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Time of Anchor Event</h2>
				<p>
					There's a reason I don't like writing these blogs in the night. It's because when I have an anchor event in the morning I tend to have a productive day.
				</p>

				<p>
					The nature of these blogs is random. I talk about anything and everything. With that whenever I get an interesting thought I have the urge to write about it. This, unfortunately, happens during the evening.
				</p>

				<p>
					Lately, as a result, I have been fighting the urge to write in the night. Sometimes I fail and write two 500 worded blogs in a day.
				</p>

				<p><i>#WhatIsTheOppositeOfWritersBlock?</i></p>

				<br>
				<h2>Effects of Anchor Event</h2>
				<p>
					Each anchor event should have a purpose-built with it. If you have read Atomic Habits by James Clear, you'd recall habit formation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					An Anchor event is like the foundation for habit formation. "The habit's you choose is the person you end up becoming".
				</p>

				<p>
					When you bring in the effects of compounding by doing a task daily, you become that person. I have two anchor events and both have a personality infused in them.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>The morning anchor event.</b> I want to be a better marketer. And every good marketer (at least the one's on twitter) have sworn by writing daily. I agree with them. Ever since I started writing daily, my thoughts have been clearer. <br>
					And since it's an anchor event, I have been setting my day to be productive.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>The Evening anchor event.</b> Better cook. I don't know why I love cooking. I sometimes see those recipe gifs on Reddit and wish to make one of those. haha, but I never could.
				</p>

				<p>
					Lockdown changed everything. I gave cooking a chance and I am a good cook. Well, at least till I have my mom to give instructions and diced vegetables.
				</p>

				<p>
					And since it's an anchor event, I know when the workday is over. And it's time to be with my family.
				</p>

				<p><i>#WorkLifeBalance</i></p>
				
				<br>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					So It's no secret that my days are better when I follow my anchor events. If you are interested as well, I say go for it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'd suggest to start with one anchor event and try to do it daily. Use a calendar. Don't be afraid. It is more afraid of you than you are afraid of it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It can be hard at first. I still struggle with mine. It's fine. Give yourself some time to settle.
