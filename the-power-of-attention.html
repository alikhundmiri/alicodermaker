			<div>


				<p>When I started working on my Instagram, I know attention is expensive. But I had no idea how big it can get.</p>

				<p>One of my hobbies is watching award shows opening ceremonies. Of my favourite is Neil Patrick Harris' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SQfsBsMFls">Tony Awards opening act</a>. Watch it here.</p>

				<p>But in this blog post (are these blog posts?) I wanna talk about Ricky Gervais and what he does. Ricky Gervais is a comedian and a writer among many other things. Will discuss this later.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Body of Works</h2>
				<p>Of the things he does, for some reason he gets invited to host the Golden Globe Awards in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2020.</p>

				<p>He does this in front of a live audience, or at least they make it so. All of these are very funny. But I was a little shocked when I realised how insulting he is to the people. And most of these people are worlds most influential directors, producers and actors. </p>

				<p>Why are they listening to him? Instead of getting rid of him, as you'd expect powerful people to be, they invited him again. Why?</p>

				<p>Remember how I told you three paragraphs before, he is a writer, among many other things? Well, he also happens to be the creator, writer, director and actor of a show called The office.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Well, its a franchise.</h2>

				<p>The original show aired on BBC in 2001. The same show was adopted a few times.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2005 The office (US, English)</li>
					<li>2006 Le Bureau (France, French)</li>
					<li>2010 HaMisrad (Israel. Hebrew)</li>
					<li>2006 La Job (Canada, French)</li>
					<li>2019 The office (India, Hindi)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Not all listed here are as famous as the original and the US version. That's where the gold is.</p>

				<p>In 2019, NBC reclaimed 'The Office' for $100 Million a year for five years.</p>

				<p>That's a half a billion-dollar deal.</p>

				<p>For office romance documentary show: not too shabby. </p>

				<p>According to this <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/british-stand-up-comedian-ricky-gervais-net-worth-in-2020/ar-BB104RoI">news article</a>, Ricky Gervais is worth $130 million.</p>
				

				<p>So. Ricky Gervais is Rich. Streaming services are fighting to get his show on their platform, this is more complex, and he is good at what he does.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Leverage</h2>

				<p>When he stands in front of the world's most powerful filmmaker, he gets to say what he wants. His work is his leverage.</p>

				<p>What he is and what he has made has a unique audience. A bunch of people who listen to what he says. The Attention. That's his power.</p> 

				<p>I have heard this before. Co-incidently by another comedian. </p>

				<p><i>Dave Chapelle.</i></p>

				<p>He is about to get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeYA72NLaDE">2019 Mark Twain Prize</a>. He gets on stage lights a cigarette mid-speech. </p>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">I want everyone in America right now to look at me. Look at me smoking indoors. I didn't ask anybody I just did it. What are they gonna do? Kick me out before I get the prize now? No [nword], this is called leverage.</blockquote>

				<p>Leverage.</p>

				<p>That's what Dave Chapelle has. That's what Ricky Gervais has. That's where wealth is. </p>

				<p>That's exactly what you get when you build your audience.</p>
