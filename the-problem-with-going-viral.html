			<div>
				<p>
					Everyone wants to go viral. But is it always good? Could it be that going viral can have the opposite effect than what you are hoping for?
				</p>

				<h3>About my content</h3>
				<p>
					In 2018 I was into programming. Then as we moved to 2020, I transited into Marketing and product building
				</p>
				<p>
					Back in 2018, a few posts of mine went "viral". I wrote viral in double-quotes because I got 3-4x the about of impressions I'd usually get. Not exactly viral, but talking relative here.
				</p>
				<p>
					For each post that went viral, Some people followed me.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now in 2020 when I post about marketing I don't get as much engagement as I should with the number of people who follow me.
				</p>

				<p>
					This low engagement with high subscribers/followers gives a signal to the algorithm.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Their audience is not interested in what they are creating"
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					The algorithm notices the disparity between your followers and your per post engagement. Your reach and impression go down.
				</p>

				<h3>When I went "viral"</h3>
				<p>
					<i>
						Now in this example, I am talking about personal brands. This won't apply to corporate brands.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					So you are posting daily. Your engagement is varying, but your audience is growing. That's always a good sign.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then one day, one of your posts goes viral. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You find yourself in front of 10,000s new users. You notice a higher number of comments, retweets and shares. They like your viral post.
				</p>
				<p>
					And, some users decide to follow you and subscribe to your channel
				</p>
				<p>
					And then... the next post is regular post. You are back to the same level of engagement. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This is where things get a tiny bit complicated. Some creators can stick to one type of content. Not all.
				</p>
				<p>
					We move along. But the audience? They want the same thing all the time.
				</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					So it still worth going viral? For brands, sure. Their message is more consistent and well thought out. For personalities? Doubt it.
