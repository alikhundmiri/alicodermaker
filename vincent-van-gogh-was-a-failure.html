Vincent Van Gogh. Failure at everything.

Everything in the world is bound by rules. When you cross those imaginary boundaries, you an outcast and labelled weird.  

But who set the rules? Who decided the unwritten rules?
{look for some rules.}


I just realised that Vincent Van Gogh, one of my favourite artists ever, was a failure at everything. Before picking up painting at the age of 27, vincent had a total of 4 jobs. 

ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh

1869. Worked at an art dealer called Goupil & Cie in The Hague.
1873. Finished training and was transferred to Goupil's London branch.
1875. His father and uncle transferred him to Paris. He became resentful due to the degree to which the firm commodified art, and he was dismissed a year later. FAILED.
1876.  Work as an unpaid supply teacher in a boarding school in Ramsgate, England. Quit when he couldn't workout changes when the proprietor moved to Isleworth, Middlesex. FAILED.
YEAR. Methodist minister's assistant.
1878. Went to live his uncle in Amsterdam. He writes the University of Amsterdam theology entrance examination and FAILED.
1878. undertook, and failed, a three-month course at a Protestant missionary school in Laken. FAILED.
1879. 
I am not counting his failures. I am showing you that he looks at the world in a different way. He questioned basic rules and tried to navigate the world with his rules.

So yes, the way he failed in being a missionary, he failed at being an artist. 

Vincent Van Gogh failed to align himself to the laws of Society.
Vincent Van Gogh failed when he tried to align the society to his laws.


This is what his Wikipedia says:
Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a failure.

We as a society have set up a bunch of rules which we all agree upon. When someone breaks these rules, we can't put our finger on it, but we know they have a way of doing things.

When people in my city see a girl riding a bike they are in shock. When I say bike, I don't mean Suzuki access or Honda Activa. I am talking about gear bikes like Bajaj Pulser and Yamaha R15. In 2020 People like Priyanka Kochhar (BikeWithGirl) are breaking and questioning stereotypes.

Why is it weird for girls to ride a bike? The answer for this is usually a baseless argument which stems to stereotype. Men are the bread earner and women are homemakers, that how it's supposed to be.

When I fail to see the answer to the objection, I fail to ask the next question.
Here is where you have two types of people.

People who are curious to know the reason for objection.
People who care less about the source of the objection, and more about policing others on this objection.

People of the first category, go ahead to ask the following questions.
Who decided that?
What was the reason for this decision?
How has the world changed since then?
The other people, oblige the rules and prosper. All the while stepping on the face of people in the first category.

Vincent Van Gogh questioned everything.


Considered as a master of art today, he failed to sell paintings during his lifetime. You know why?

Because he had his own rules.  

Skill? Potential? Luck?

I don't think Vincent Van Gogh was skilled. I believe he had extreme potential. 

Every job he did before picking up painting, has a set of rules. Operate within these, and you will prosper.

But painting is different. A canvas doesn't care how you stroke your brush.  There's no right or wrong way to paint anything. Sure there are techniques which you can learn to become a painter. 

Van Gogh had his own approach to a painting, like with everything else in his life. 

Artist, Art collectors and Art experts know this. Everyone who saw his paintings back then knows something was off.  And that is why no one bought any of his work. Everyone knows his paintings were made by following the silently accepted mutually rules.
